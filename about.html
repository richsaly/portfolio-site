          <p>Now I picked up the huddle to join the race of frontend website development in the year 2021,I started watching tutorial videos and personal researchs<br>As it gets tough, i began to buy paid courses from UDEMY, and this so much helped me and with senior coligues who are always there to hold my hands<br> in the journey, with time also, i began to join internships like I4G x Zuri Internship, Side hustle internships and these honestly brushed me up in the game<br> because they exposed me to connecting with people far and near.</p>
          <br>
          <p>I started by learning UI desings, and in this i learnt FIGMA,SKETCH and ADOBE XD. In making progress, i moved on to coding, that is writing website interface<br> with codes. To achieve these, i started buy learning HTML moved to CSS then JavaScript which are the foundamentals of frontend website development and<br> still learning other programing languages to up my game in the fild.Because in programing, learning never ends..  </p>
